# Conversion_2D_INTO_1D_Arry
In this Project we have Converted 2-Dimensional Array into 1-D 

Declare int veriables i,,j,k,n1 and n2 =0;

first of all we have to define how many elements we want to store into 2-D

and then add the elements into it.

then the second loop showing the elements which are stored in 2-D

then we add the elements of 2-D into 1-D 

then the last loop is showing the all elements which had been stored into 1-D
